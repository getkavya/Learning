Partitioning and Bucketing 

Static partitioning :- Load data manually into partition table
Dynamic partitioning :-  We do not load data manually. Load data from non partition table to partition table. (insertion into table)

Bucketing :- Creating more flat file under directory. File should have nearly same amount of data.

Partition is directory and bucketing is flat file.

Bucketed table only we can only insert data.
Hive bucket property is by default = false. Need to set it explicitly.


=========================
Join 

Default join in hive is map set join. No reducer.
Map reduce join is inefficient. Reducer is doing job.

File format

JSON
RC
Parquet
ORC
=========================

Hive is processing engine. DB is only for storage.
