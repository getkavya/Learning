YARN - yet another resources. To Manage resources for big data.
Only manages resources of cluster.

MapReduce - to process data.

HDFS - Hadoop (2.X) - in year 2013 .. 3 logical components

	1. HDFS(Storage component)
	2. YARN(Management Component)
	3. Map Reduce(Processing Component)

Property of Hadoop- (Replication factor)   

	1. Even in case of fault, data is highly available to process.
	2. Fault tolerable
	3. Reliable
	
Default factor is 3

Term - Rack-1, Rack-2
HDFS block size default is - 128MB. We can configure it through Hadoop.

Slaves/Master.

Master (Name Node) :- metadata in each memory
Name Node 
Slave (Data).
Secondary name node, Data node

Demon process - 5 demon should run
	1. Yarn demon  - Resource manager and node manager
	2. Resource manager, name node,  --master
	3. Node manager, Data node -- Slave
	4. Secondary node
	5. Edge node --> in production … will never contact directly to name node.

=====================================================

Single node architecture
-- All 5 demons run in one machine and one JVM
Multi node architecture
-- different machine and different JVM
Pseudo architecture
	- Similar to single node - on one single system only
	- Similar to multi node - different JVM on same machine
======================================================
Ports

Name node default port :- 50070
Default port of Yarn - 8088
